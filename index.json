Anaomical regions and corresponding texts (visual grounding) on the other hand, can be mined in an automatic fashion, and is, therefore, available at a large scale.\nHow does it work? Fig. 1. Overview: Anatomical regions are first detected using a CNN backbone and a shallow detector. For each region, observed pathologies are predicted using a shared classifier. Bounding boxes for each pathology are then predicted by considering regions with positive predictions and fusing overlapping boxes.\nHow well does it work? Fig. 2. Qualitative results of Loc-ADPD, with predicted (solid) and target (dashed) boxes. Cardiomegaly (red) is detected almost perfectly, as it is always exactly localized at one anatomical region. Other pathologies like atelectasis (blue), effusion (green), or pneumonia (cyan) are detected but often with non-perfect overlapping boxes. Detection also works well for predicting several overlapping pathologies (second from left).\nTab. 1. Results on the NIH ChestX-ray 8 dataset. Our models Loc-ADPD and MIL-ADPD, trained using anatomy (An) bounding boxes, both outperform all weakly supervised methods trained with image-level pathology (Pa) and anatomy-level pathol- ogy (An-Pa) labels by a large margin.

However, annotating pathology bounding boxes is a time-consuming task such that large public datasets for this purpose are scarce. Current approaches thus use weakly supervised object detection to learn the (rough) localization of pathologies from image-level annotations, which is however limited in performance due to the lack of bounding box supervision. We therefore propose anatomy-driven pathology detection (ADPD), which uses easy-to-annotate bounding boxes of anatomical regions as proxies for pathologies. We study two training approaches -- supervised training using anatomy-level pathology labels and multiple instance learning (MIL) with image-level pathology labels. Our results show that our anatomy-level training approach outperforms weakly supervised methods and fully supervised detection with limited training samples, and our MIL approach is competitive with both baseline approaches, therefore demonstrating the potential of our approach.","tags":[],"title":"Anatomy-Driven Pathology Detection on Chest X-rays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felix Meissen","Svenja Breuer","Moritz Knolle","Alena Buyx","Ruth Müller","Georgios Kaissis","Benedikt Wiestler","Daniel Rückert"],"categories":null,"content":"Summary Background With the ever-increasing amount of medical imaging data, the demand for algorithms to assist clinicians has amplified. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) models promise to aid in the crucial first step of disease detection. While previous studies have thoroughly explored fairness in supervised models in healthcare, for UAD, this has so far been unexplored.\nMethods In this study, we evaluated how dataset composition regarding subgroups manifests in disparate performance of UAD models along multiple protected variables on three large-scale publicly available chest X-ray datasets. Our experiments were validated using two state-of-the-art UAD models for medical images. Finally, we introduced a novel subgroup-AUROC (sAUROC) metric, which aids in quantifying fairness in machine learning.\nFindings Our experiments revealed empirical “fairness laws” (similar to “scaling laws” for Transformers) for training-dataset composition: Linear relationships between anomaly detection performance within a subpopulation and its representation in the training data. Our study further revealed performance disparities, even in the case of balanced training data, and compound effects that exacerbate the drop in performance for subjects associated with multiple adversely affected groups.\nInterpretation Our study quantified the disparate performance of UAD models against certain demographic subgroups. Importantly, we showed that this unfairness cannot be mitigated by balanced representation alone. Instead, the representation of some subgroups seems harder to learn by UAD models than that of others. The empirical fairness laws discovered in our study make disparate performance in UAD models easier to estimate and aid in determining the most desirable dataset composition.\nResults Fig. 3: a) A linear relationship between the representation of a subgroup in the training dataset and its performance was observed across all datasets and subgroups. Equal representation of subgroups did not produce the most group-fair results. Experimental results for the FAE on the MIMIC-CXR, CXR14, and CheXpert datasets trained under different gender, age, or race imbalance ratios. Each box extends from the lower to upper quartile values of ten runs with different random seeds with a line at the median. Regression lines along the different imbalance ratios are additionally plotted. The exact numbers can be found in the Appendix. b) The mean absolute errors (MAE) between the real subgroup performances and those estimated using the “fairness laws” for each dataset and protected variable. Each box again shows the results over ten runs with different random seeds.\n","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693526400,"objectID":"a1ad4bca22cec1ee4a1afe1918e40519","permalink":"https://felix-meissen.github.io/publication/fairness/","publishdate":"2023-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fairness/","section":"publication","summary":"We discovered that performance bias between demographic subgroups in unsupervised anomaly detection follows certain patterns, making it highly predictable.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"(Predictable) Performance Bias in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ioannis Lagogiannis","Felix Meissen","Georgios Kaissis","Daniel Rückert"],"categories":null,"content":"Results We compared 13 different anomaly detection models from 4 categories (Image Reconstruction (IR), Feature-modeling (FM), Attention-based (AB), and self-supervised (S-S)) on four different real-world medical datasets.

Especially in the biomedical domain, annotations are subjective and suffer from low inter- and intra-rater reliability. Since annotations only reflect one interpretation of the real world, this can lead to sub-optimal predictions even though the model achieves high similarity scores. Here, the theoretical concept of PGT is introduced. PGT marks the point beyond which an increase in similarity with the \\emph{reference annotation} stops translating to better RWMP. Additionally, a quantitative technique to approximate PGT by computing inter- and intra-rater reliability is proposed.
